        <p style="color: #BAFFB4;">Holi is an ancient festival of India and was originally known as 'Holika'. The festivals finds a detailed description in early religious works such as Jaimini's Purvamimamsa-Sutras and Kathaka-Grhya-Sutras. Historians also believe that Holi was celebrated by all Aryans but more so in the Eastern part of India.</p>

        <p style="color: #BAFFB4">Holi also celebrates the Hindu god Krishna and the legend of Holika and Prahlad. Hiranyakashipu was an evil king. He had special powers that made him nearly invincible and he wanted everyone in his kingdom to worship him. He was so powerful he started to act like a god and punished or killed anyone who disobeyed him.</p>

        <p style="color: #BAFFB4">It is said that Holi existed several centuries before Christ. However, the meaning of the festival is believed to have changed over the years. Earlier it was a special rite performed by married women for the happiness and well-being of their families and the full moon (Raka) was worshiped.
